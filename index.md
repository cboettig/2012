I am a graduate student with 
[Alan Hastings](http://two.ucdavis.edu/%7Eme "Alan Hastings") in the 
[Population Biology](http://www-eve.ucdavis.edu/eve/pbg/) Ph.D program at UC
Davis, working on regime shifts in ecology and evolution. Such shifts mark the
most dramatic events in complex systems; understanding and forecasting these 
events challenges the capacity of both our statistical methods and the data 
available. My [research](http://www.carlboettiger.info/research) aims to extend
and quantify the limits of understanding through uncertainty modeling, high
performance computing and large data sets. I am funded by a DoE Computational 
Science Graduate Fellowship
([CSGF](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/community/fellows/profile?n=boettiger)).
I keep an open [lab notebook](http://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html),
as I describe in this
[introduction](http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/211).
