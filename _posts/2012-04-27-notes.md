# Ecology

## [PDG Control](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control)

 Has become a variety of different directions: 

### [Policy Costs](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/tree/master/inst/examples/policycosts)

* Considering different norms
* When can policy costs pay for themselves?

### Additional Noise

* Starts with replicating Sethi et al. (2005).
* Consider the performance of various non-optimal solutions, particularly regarding imperfect implementation
* These are losely collected in [Robustness examples](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/tree/master/inst/examples/robustness), needs some evaluation of the most interesting. 

### Approaches to parameter, structural, and state uncertainty

* (Morph of) Training problem II from the working group. 
* Active adaptive management using grid -- for model choice example. DONE
* Add: Myopic Bayes passive adaptive management for model choice
* Compare to: stationary (no learning) solution averaging over models


## [Warning signals](https://github.com/cboettig/earlywarning)

 * Accepted!
 * Copy up on arxiv. 
 * Streamline code and examples. Began updating functions to work in a more generic manner that is better for connecting in pipelines and swapping between indicators.  Move examples over from wiki to `inst/examples`. 
 * What to do with older repo `warningsignals` vs newer codebase `earlywarning`?


## Fallacy

 * Write introduction with more basic background on warning signals
 * Touch up discussion, edits.
 * Updated runs from codebase. Heavy computation makes quick replication difficult

# Evolution

I'm also still wrapping up a variety of projects on the Evolution front. 

## [treebase](https://github.com/ropensci/treebase)

 * [Dynamic manuscript](https://github.com/ropensci/treeBASE/tree/master/inst/doc/treebase).  Reorganize, simplify?
 * add, document, employ the additional functions to avoid `sapply` commands.
 * Prune examples?
 * iEvoBio challenge entry?

## [Wrightscape](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape)

 * Start synthesizing documents
 * [Evidence for release in open lever ratio and kt](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/master/inst/examples/manuscript.md)
 * [Illustrating the different models](https://github.com/cboettig/wrightscape/blob/master/inst/examples/simulate_release.md)
 * Consider updated data format outputs and graphical processing functions for the model choice steps

## [fishbase](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase)

 * submitted! [Dynamic document](https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/tree/master/inst/doc/rfishbase)
 * handling of reference ids example for Patrick
 * Working word templatese for Pandoc odt/docx?
 * Push updated copy to CRAN

## [Adaptive dynamics](https://github.com/cboettig/AdaptiveDynamics)

 * What to do with time-to-branching results from Vienna with Ulf?
 * What to do with nice fast branching process simulation code?
