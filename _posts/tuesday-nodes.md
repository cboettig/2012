## Costs of information

* when/are the policies equivalent regardless of the noise? 


## PDG Control

* Bohm 1974 
* Sigh _et al._ 2006 essentially treats this problem but with two control variables -- fishing fleet and harvest level.  
Highlights the tradeoff: want a variable harvest rate since Jensen's inequality guarantees that a fixed harvest rate will under-perform in stochastic stock, but need a smoother change to avoid adjustment costs to the fleet.  

(Show the underperformance of the fixed harvest rate?)
