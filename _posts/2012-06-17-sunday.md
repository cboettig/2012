* Sent in my review for PLoS ONE.  No way to attach pdf files, had to create and send a secure link instead to provide comments on the pdf.
* [AIC discussion on r-sig-phylo](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-phylo/2012-June/thread.html).  For a derivation I refer to `r citet("10.1016/S0167-7152(96)00128-9")`, also see [Daniel Schmidt's slides](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dschmidt/ModelSectionTutorial1_SchmidtMakalic_2008.pdf).  Aikaike's original paper does the derivation less deliberately than Cavanaugh but does discuss this Frequentist intepretation as the maximum expected log likelihood `r citep("10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705")`.
