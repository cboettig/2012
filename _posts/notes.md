### Value of information

- To better get at Jim's question, should compare (profit from growth only noise) - (profit from deterministic) + ((profit from measurement only) - (profit from deterministic)) to (profit from growth+measurement) - (determinsitic), i.e. is (growth+measurement) greater/less than (growth) + (measurement) - deterministic?   
- Clarify this!  is (profit from growth only) the case in which (a) the manager includes growth noise in the solution when in reality it is absent (hence the deterministic solution is optimal), (b) the case where the manager includes growth noise and it is present (i.e. both are optimal given reality, but reality differs, not the information) 
- when/are the policies equivalent regardless of the noise?

## PDG Control

* Bohm 1974 
* Sigh _et al._ 2006 essentially treats this problem but with two control variables -- fishing fleet and harvest level.  
Highlights the tradeoff: want a variable harvest rate since Jensen's inequality guarantees that a fixed harvest rate will under-perform in stochastic stock, but need a smoother change to avoid adjustment costs to the fleet.  

(Show the underperformance of the fixed harvest rate?)
