### Value of information

- To better get at Jim's question, should compare (profit from growth only noise) - (profit from deterministic) + ((profit from measurement only) - (profit from deterministic)) to (profit from growth+measurement) - (determinsitic), i.e. is (growth+measurement) greater/less than (growth) + (measurement) - deterministic?   
- Clarify this!  is (profit from growth only) the case in which (a) the manager includes growth noise in the solution when in reality it is absent (hence the deterministic solution is optimal), (b) the case where the manager includes growth noise and it is present (i.e. both are optimal given reality, but reality differs, not the information) (c) the
