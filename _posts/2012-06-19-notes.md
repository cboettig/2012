Sunday
------

* Sent in my review for PLoS ONE.  No way to attach pdf files, had to create and send a secure link instead to provide comments on the pdf.

* [AIC discussion on r-sig-phylo](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-phylo/2012-June/thread.html).  For a derivation I refer to `r citet("10.1016/S0167-7152(96)00128-9")`, also see [Daniel Schmidt's slides](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dschmidt/ModelSectionTutorial1_SchmidtMakalic_2008.pdf).  Aikaike's original paper does the derivation less deliberately than Cavanaugh but does discuss this Frequentist intepretation as the maximum expected log likelihood `r citep("10.1109/TAC.1974.1100705")`.  

Monday 
------

* Discussing peerJ, NCEAS
* knitcitations on CRAN
* Check fallacy appendix

### Value of information meeting

* check surprising result in growth noise using negative shocks only. Done: [confirms expected behavior.](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/issues/14)
* run with Sethi exact settings (overnight, [results](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/master/inst/examples/voi_sethi_parameters.md))
* Think about Mike's point in differences between parameter uncertainty and stochasticity.  See [cost_of_bias.md results](https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/blob/d8d46087d8194e10488eeb79790293fcbde0e58e/inst/examples/cost_of_bias.md) as a starting point.    


Tuesday
-------

* check fallacy appendix
* edits to knitcitations from feedback
* Use github url for all package pages on CRAN
* Submitted fallacy paper! 


Wednesday
---------

### Value of information 

* debugging Sethi exact settings.  Try running logistic + uniform shocks on Reed-only noise.  

### Evolution stuff

* treebase finalize edits?
* ievobio submission?
* wrightscape edits



## Misc CSS notes

CSS [can't replace LaTeX yet](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1319/showcase-of-beautiful-typography-done-in-tex-friends), but it's getting most of the basics of good typography.  We might at least have LaTeX quality justified text soon, see: 

* [Ligatures, font-kerning](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/#font-variant-ligatures-prop)
* [hyphenating](http://skinnywhitegirl.com/blog/web-typography-hyphenation-justification/475/)
* [dropcaps and more](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-typography-01/)
* [font spacing](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-typography-02/)
* [examples](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-typography-03/)
