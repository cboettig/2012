Source Code for my Jekyll-based website
=======================================

- Primary server for site: [carlboettiger.info](http://carlboettiger.info), hosted by Dreamhost
- Github mirror of site: [cboettig.github.com](https://cboettig.github.com)

Both the above locations host only the compiled html files of the site, not the original Jekyll source used to produce them.
The working source directory can be found in its github repository: [jekyll-source](http://github.com/cboettig/jekyll-source)
